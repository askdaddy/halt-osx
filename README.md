# halt-osx
A simple OS X app to remind the user to take breaks during work.

The app displays a status item in the system status bar. Here [RHStatusItemView](https://github.com/heardrwt/RHStatusItemView) by heardrwt is used.

Preference panels are not implemented.

My [blog page](http://kanari.logdown.com/posts/2015/02/23/os-x-development-from-complete-noob-to-almost-not-a-noob) containing implementations details (in Chinese).
